# public-papers

This repo contains finished versions of read-only source (LaTeX, Word, txt, etc.) 
for my public or published research papers.

Generally, there is one directory per paper and this will remain a relatively flat
structure. Papers are versioned through git. From time to time a paper may be patched
in a minor way (typo, etc.). This will be reflected in the git revision history so
that nothing gets memory holed. From time to time, "margin notes" may be added to 
papers to reflect feedback and dialectic.

Papers are drawn from private repos/directories reflecting the work done on the paper
while the research is not mature.

Paper directories contain:

- the paper source
- the paper binary (a PDF)
- A manifest/README.md with:
  - a .bib citation entry
  - a pointer to any other published version of the paper
  - a copyright notice
  - ArXiv pointer (if applicable)
  - a DOI (if applicable)
  - pointer to slides or talks / audio / video
- to the extent possible, data related to graphs or charts in the paper
- occasionally, slides related to the paper
